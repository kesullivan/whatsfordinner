Long list of different ideas for dinner or meals in general
Include pictures of what we cook
    This would be a good opportunity for photography also 
click button to see whats for dinner and have a yes or no
Implement a system like Anki where a 'no' pushes that dinner idea off longer and a 'yes' means this needs to be reviewed more often

Store the recipes too so you can make a shopping list

Need a way to add new ideas

possibly select multiple meals so we could plan ahead and add that all to one shopping list with exact quanitites 

If one meal has multiple variations select yes on meal then it will bring you to which variation do you want (so you can select the one you want for a shopping list)

If its completly offline then databases will not be synced, maybe I do have to have it online
